# University
This repository contains all of the material downloaded or created for the university (Bachelor's Degree on Computer Science, started in 2022 at "UNICT - Universit√† degli Studi di Catania") until now.

Most of the material is in italian. I don't guarantee all the work is correct.

You will mainly find .pdf, .xopp (Xournal++) and .md files.
The markdown files have been written using Obsidian; to properly render all the files I suggest you to [download it](https://obsidian.md/download).
### Why I'm sharing this material

I've written everything just for myself (just to study), didn't really plan to make all of this public.

The main reason I'm choosing to share this material is that some people have asked me to send them some subjects' content. Having this space allows me to redirect them in this repository instead of zipping and sending the files or folders individually.

### Folders Structure

Every folder name contains the subject name with a prefix of four digits which mean:
- The first digit refers to the year of the subject
- The second digit refers to the semester of the subject
- The third and fourth digits refer to the subject id (which I randomly set)

### My Google Sheet

I track all my marks and exams in a [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fZZPt1zc6c_K6VdMn6nS60H-tv2VyBzxq3R2oebD4-A).
I take this opportunity to share it since I'm proud of how it came out. Feel free to copy it and make it yours.

### Contribution

I'm open to errors reports, if you find any I'd be happy to correct them.
